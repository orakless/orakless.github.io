           <p>Psychedelic fast-paced platformer.</br> <span class="tag">game</span> <span class="tag">plateformer</span> <span class="tag">godot</span> <span class="tag">GDScript</span></p>
<p>This game is my first true game. I entirely made the assets, the idea came because I'm a BIG fan of Super Meat Boy (which is one of my favorite games) and I wanted to do a fast-paced platformer.</p>

<p>This game is under development. I can't give you a release date because I don't really know when I'll release it, but you can look on my itch.io, I'll write some devlogs when I'll found the time (and ideas)</p>
